    <details>
      <summary>Learn about American Foulbrood</summary>
      <p><strong>American Foulbrood (AFB)</strong> is a bacterial disease that affects honeybee brood. It is one of the most severe and 
        contagious diseases that honeybees can face. If left untreated, it can lead to the death of an entire colony. If you do suspect 
        foulbrood contact your National Bee Unit Inspector for further advice — this is a <strong><a href="https://www.nationalbeeunit.com/" 
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportable</a></strong> disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> AFB affects bee larvae in the early stages of development. The larvae infected with AFB will turn 
        brown and emit a foul odour. As the disease progresses, the infected larvae will die and form a hard, black scale at the bottom 
        of the cell. The scale is highly infectious and can infect other larvae in the colony. Infected bees may also have sunken and 
        perforated cappings, and the colony may have a weak or queenless appearance.</p>

      <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> There is no cure for AFB once a colony is infected. The only effective treatment is to destroy 
        the infected hive and equipment to prevent the spread of the disease. This is necessary because AFB spores can survive for a 
        long time and can be easily spread by contaminated equipment, such as frames and hives. Beekeepers must contact their local 
        beekeeping association or state apiary inspector to report a suspected AFB outbreak.</p>

      <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong> Preventing AFB is the best strategy to avoid losing entire colonies to the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Use Clean Equipment:</strong> Ensure that all equipment used in beekeeping, including frames and hives, are clean and 
        free from any AFB spores. The use of irradiation, flaming, or chemical treatments can help eliminate spores.</p>

      <p><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> Proper hygiene practices such as hand washing, and wearing clean protective clothing 
        can help prevent the spread of AFB.</p>

      <p><strong>Monitor Colonies:</strong> Regular inspections of colonies can help beekeepers detect early signs of AFB. If an infection 
        is detected early, it is easier to contain and prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Re-queen:</strong> Re-queening can help prevent AFB, as a new queen can introduce a stronger genetic strain that is more 
        resistant to the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Educate Beekeepers:</strong> Educating beekeepers on AFB, its symptoms, and the importance 
        of <strong><a href="https://www.nationalbeeunit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a></strong> any suspected 
        outbreaks can help prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> American Foulbrood is a severe disease that can have devastating effects on honeybee colonies. 
        Prevention measures such as good hygiene practices, the use of clean equipment, and regular monitoring of colonies can help 
        reduce the risk of an outbreak. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to report it to the local beekeeping association or 
        state apiary inspector to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

    <h3 id="european-foulbrood">European Foulbrood</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Learn about European Foulbrood</summary>
      <p><strong>European Foulbrood (EFB)</strong> is a bacterial disease that affects honeybee brood. While not as severe as 
        American Foulbrood, EFB can weaken colonies and impact honey production. If you do suspect foulbrood contact your National 
        Bee Unit Inspector for further advice — this is a reportable disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> EFB primarily affects bee larvae in the early stages of development. The infected larvae will 
        turn yellowish-brown and twist into a characteristic \"S\" shape. As the disease progresses, the larvae will die and form a 
        dried-out, brown scale at the bottom of the cell. Unlike AFB, the scale is not hard and can be easily removed. The infected 
        bees may also have perforated cappings and a spotty brood pattern.</p>

      <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> There is no cure for EFB once a colony is infected. However, unlike AFB, EFB-infected colonies 
        can sometimes recover on their own. The best treatment for EFB is to support the colony's immune system by providing proper 
        nutrition, minimizing stress, and ensuring the hive has adequate ventilation. In severe cases, antibiotics such as 
        oxytetracycline or tylosin may be prescribed by a veterinarian or licensed beekeeper.</p>

      <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong> Preventing EFB is the best strategy to avoid the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Use Clean Equipment:</strong> Ensure that all equipment used in beekeeping, including frames and hives, are clean and 
        free from any EFB spores. The use of irradiation, flaming, or chemical treatments can help eliminate spores.</p>

      <p><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> Proper hygiene practices such as hand washing, and wearing clean protective clothing 
        can help prevent the spread of EFB.</p>

      <p><strong>Monitor Colonies:</strong> Regular inspections of colonies can help beekeepers detect early signs of EFB. If an infection 
        is detected early, it is easier to contain and prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Re-queen:</strong> Re-queening can help prevent EFB, as a new queen can introduce a stronger genetic strain that is more 
        resistant to the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Educate Beekeepers:</strong> Educating beekeepers on EFB, its symptoms, and the importance of reporting any suspected 
        outbreaks can help prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> European Foulbrood is a bacterial disease that can weaken honeybee colonies and impact honey production. 
        While there is no cure for EFB, infected colonies can sometimes recover on their own with proper support. Prevention measures such 
        as good hygiene practices, the use of clean equipment, and regular monitoring of colonies can help reduce the risk of an outbreak.</p>

    <h3 id="melissococcus">Melissococcus Plutonius</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Learn about Melissococcus Plutonius</summary>
      <p><strong>Foulbrood</strong> is a general term used to describe bacterial infections that affect honeybee larvae. The two main 
        types are American Foulbrood (AFB) and European Foulbrood (EFB), each caused by different bacterial pathogens.</p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> In general, foulbrood-infected larvae exhibit discoloration, unusual positioning within cells, 
        a foul smell, and cell cappings that may appear sunken or perforated. Infected colonies may show a spotty brood pattern, weakened 
        bee numbers, or even queenlessness.</p>

      <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> Treatment depends on the specific foulbrood type. AFB often requires the destruction of affected 
        colonies and equipment, while EFB may sometimes be managed through supportive care and antibiotic treatment under veterinary guidance. 
        Early diagnosis is critical.</p>

      <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong></p>

        <div class="indented-list">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly sterilise tools and avoid sharing equipment between colonies.</li>
              <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Conduct routine hive inspections to identify symptoms early.</li>
              <li><strong>Record-Keeping:</strong> Track colony health to notice patterns over time and isolate issues quickly.</li>
              <li><strong>Education:</strong> Ensure all beekeepers in your association or apiary group are aware of the signs, 
                reporting requirements, and management procedures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Foulbrood is a serious threat to colony health. Early identification, appropriate treatment, 
        and consistent hygienic practices are key to preventing its spread and maintaining healthy, productive hives.</p>

    <h3 id="foulbrood">Foulbrood (General)</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Learn about General Foulbrood Infections</summary>
      <p><strong>Foulbrood</strong> is a bacterial disease that affects honeybees, and it is considered one of the most serious threats 
        to honeybee colonies. There are two types of foulbrood: American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB). Both types are 
        caused by different bacteria and have different symptoms, treatments, and prevention measures.</p>

      <p><strong>American foulbrood (AFB):</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Sunken, greasy, and perforated brood cells that are brown or black in colour. Larvae die before they 
        reach the pupal stage, leaving behind a foul-smelling, ropy, and light-brown liquid. As the disease progresses, the scales of the 
        affected brood cells become dark and hard, and they can stick to the bottom of the cell.</p>

      <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> If a hive is suspected of having AFB, the infected colony should be destroyed by fire or a method 
        approved by local authorities to prevent the spread of the disease. Preventing the spread of AFB is the best course of action. 
        Beekeepers can use a variety of methods to prevent the disease, including practicing good hygiene, replacing old comb, using 
        antibiotics, and re-queening.</p>

      <p><strong>Prevention measures:</strong> Regular hive inspections and maintaining good hygiene are crucial in preventing AFB. 
        Beekeepers should avoid feeding honey or pollen that has not been treated to prevent the spread of AFB. Replacing old comb 
        with new frames can also help prevent the spread of AFB.</p>

      <p><strong>European foulbrood (EFB):</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Larvae in EFB-infected cells turn yellow, then brown, before dying. Unlike AFB, the larvae die after 
        they are capped. The affected cells are twisted or curled, and the caps may be sunken.</p>

      <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> EFB can be treated with antibiotics, such as oxytetracycline, which can be given to the bees in the 
        form of medicated syrup or dust. In severe cases, the colony may need to be re-queened.</p>

      <p><strong>Prevention measures:</strong> Maintaining good hygiene in the hive, such as regularly cleaning and disinfecting equipment, 
        can help prevent EFB. Beekeepers should also replace old comb with new frames to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Foulbrood is a serious threat to honeybee colonies, and prevention measures are the best course of 
        action. Early detection and treatment are essential to preventing the spread of the disease. Beekeepers should practice good hygiene and regularly inspect their hives to catch any signs of foulbrood early.</p>
