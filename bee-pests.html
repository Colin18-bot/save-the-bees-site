				<summary>Learn about the Small Hive Beetle</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Small hive beetles</strong> (Aethina tumida) are a pest that can cause significant damage to honeybee colonies. Originally from sub-Saharan Africa, they have spread to North America, Europe, and Australia. They
					primarily attack weak or stressed colonies and can multiply rapidly.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Adult beetles:</strong> About 1/4 inch long, dark brown or black, easily identifiable by size and shape.</li>
						<li><strong>Larvae:</strong> White, grub-like, found in honeycomb, pollen, and brood cells. They feed and cause widespread damage.</li>
						<li><strong>Foul odour:</strong> Caused by beetle feces and fermentation of honey.</li>
						<li><strong>Damage to comb:</strong> Tunneling and destruction of honeycomb structure.</li>
						<li><strong>Weakened colony:</strong> Stress and resource depletion leading to colony decline.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Treatments:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Traps:</strong> Includes oil traps and bait traps to catch adult beetles inside the hive.</li>
						<li><strong>Chemical treatments:</strong> Such as coumaphos or permethrin—effective but must be used cautiously.</li>
						<li><strong>Diatomaceous earth:</strong> A natural solution that dries out beetles and kills them.</li>
						<li><strong>Screened bottom boards:</strong> Allow ventilation but block beetle entry.</li>
						<li><strong>Beetle traps:</strong> Various trap types designed to remove beetles from the hive.</li>
						<li><strong>Quarantining new bees:</strong> Prevents introducing beetles or pests into existing colonies.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Maintain strong colonies:</strong> Healthy, vigorous colonies are more resistant to infestation.</li>
						<li><strong>Keep hives clean:</strong> Regular cleaning and removal of old comb reduces breeding sites.</li>
						<li><strong>Reduce entrances:</strong> Smaller openings limit beetle access to the hive.</li>
						<li><strong>Monitor regularly:</strong> Frequent inspections help detect infestations early.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Cures:</strong> There is no complete cure for small hive beetle infestations, but they can be managed.</p>

				<p>
					Through strong hive management, regular monitoring, and proper treatment, beekeepers can control infestations and protect their colonies. Prevention is often more effective than treatment, so proactive hive care is
					essential.

			<h3 id="braula-coeca">Braula Coeca</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Learn about Braula Coeca</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Braula coeca</strong>, commonly known as the bee louse, is a parasitic insect that affects honeybees. While not a major threat to colony health, infestations can weaken individual bees and reduce hive
					productivity.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Visible small, reddish-brown insects resembling tiny lobsters on adult bees</li>
						<li>Weaker and less active bees</li>
						<li>Generally no severe symptoms affecting the entire colony</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Treatments:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Powdered sugar dusting:</strong> Causes lice to lose grip and fall off bees; may require multiple treatments</li>
						<li><strong>Permethrin (insecticide):</strong> Can be sprayed on bees and hive but should be used with extreme caution to avoid harming bees</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Maintain a clean and debris-free hive</li>
						<li>Practice good hygiene when handling bees, equipment, and clothing to avoid cross-contamination</li>
						<li>Conduct regular hive inspections to detect lice early</li>
						<li>Act promptly to treat and isolate any infested hives</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					While bee louse infestations are typically minor, they can still reduce hive efficiency and productivity. Prevention through cleanliness and hygiene is the best defence, while treatment using powdered sugar or
					insecticides can help manage existing infestations.

			<h3 id="mice">Mice</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Learn about Mice</summary>
				<p><strong>Mice</strong> are a common pest that can infest honeybee hives, particularly during the winter months when bee activity is low and warmth attracts rodents.</p>

				<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Mice may cause:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Chewed honeycomb and wax, damaging hive structure</li>
						<li>Loss of honey and pollen stores</li>
						<li>Contamination with diseases such as salmonella and E. coli</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Treatments:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Install <strong>mouse guards</strong> made of metal mesh or foam on hive entrances</li>
						<li>Use <strong>mouse traps or bait stations</strong> around the hive (ensure safe placement)</li>
						<li>Remove and replace any contaminated combs or frames if infection is suspected</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Inspect hives regularly for cracks or gaps; repair promptly</li>
						<li>Keep the area around hives clean and free from food debris</li>
						<li>Remove fallen or excess honeycomb to reduce attraction</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Mice can cause the following problems in a hive:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Nest building:</strong> Taking up valuable space and disrupting bees</li>
						<li><strong>Food consumption:</strong> Eating winter stores meant for bees</li>
						<li><strong>Stress and damage:</strong> Movement disturbs bees and damages the comb</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Management Strategies:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Hive entrance reducers:</strong> Help exclude mice while allowing bee access</li>
						<li><strong>Mouse guards:</strong> Metal screens installed from September to April</li>
						<li><strong>Underfloor hive entrances:</strong> Make it harder for predators to enter</li>
						<li><strong>Traps:</strong> Use live or snap traps if mice have already entered</li>
						<li><strong>Repellents:</strong> Peppermint oil or dried mint leaves placed around hives</li>
						<li><strong>Predators:</strong> Some beekeepers use cats or barn owls for natural control</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				-

				<p>Mice are less destructive than wax moths or hive beetles, but they still pose a risk to hive health. Prevention, regular checks, and timely action are key to maintaining a strong, pest-free colony.</p>

			<h3 id="asian-hornet">Asian Hornet</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Learn about the Asian Hornet</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Asian hornets</strong> (Vespa Velutina) are a predatory species that can pose a significant threat to honeybees and other pollinators. Originally from Asia, they have spread to other parts of the world, including
					Europe. In the UK, they were first identified in 2016, raising concerns about their impact on native bee populations.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Behaviour and Threat:</strong> Asian hornets prey on honeybees by hovering outside hive entrances, waiting to capture and kill returning foragers. They decapitate bees and bring their thoraxes back to their own
					nests to feed their young. This predation can significantly weaken or destroy entire colonies.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Beekeeper Actions:</strong> Beekeepers can:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Install hornet traps near hive entrances to capture and remove hornets.</li>
						<li>Regularly monitor hives and report sightings of Asian hornets.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Prevention Measures for the Public:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Check imported goods like plants or vehicles for hornet presence.</li>
						<li>Remove fallen fruit from gardens, which can attract hornets.</li>
						<li>Seal outdoor bins or containers to eliminate sweet scents.</li>
						<li>Avoid disturbing nests and instead contact local authorities.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					<strong>Reporting Sightings:</strong> It's crucial to report sightings of Asian hornets. In the UK, this can be done via the Non-Native Species Secretariat (NNSS) website or by emailing
					<a href="mailto:alertnonnative@ceh.ac.uk">alertnonnative@ceh.ac.uk</a>. Rapid response is essential to controlling their spread.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Seasonal Activity of Asian Hornets in the UK:</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Spring:</strong> Queens emerge from hibernation and begin building small nests in trees, bushes, or structures.</p>

				<p><strong>Summer:</strong> Colonies grow rapidly, and hornets actively prey on honeybees and other insects. Nests become larger and more visible.</p>

				<p><strong>Autumn:</strong> The queen stops laying eggs; the colony declines. Hornets become less active and are often found in or near nests.</p>

				<p><strong>Winter:</strong> Colonies die off. Only new queens survive by hibernating in sheltered locations, emerging again in spring.</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Summary:</strong> Asian hornets are a non-native invasive species that pose a real danger to pollinators in the UK. Monitoring, reporting, and preventive measures are essential to protect honeybee populations.
					Beekeepers and the public alike play an important role in preventing their spread.

			<h3 id="ants">Ants</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Learn about Ants</summary>
				<p><strong>Ants</strong> can be a nuisance for beekeepers as they can invade hives and steal honey, pollen, and larvae. If left unchecked, ant infestations can weaken the colony and even cause colony collapse.</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Symptoms:</strong> The presence of ants in and around the beehive is the main symptom of an infestation. Ants may be seen crawling over the hive or even inside it, stealing honey, pollen, and brood. Colonies may
					show signs of stress and reduced productivity due to the disturbance caused by ants.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Treatments and Prevention Measures:</strong></p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Keep the hive dry:</strong> Ants are attracted to moisture. Ensure good ventilation and use a hive stand to keep the hive off the ground.</li>
						<li><strong>Keep the hive clean:</strong> Regularly clean the hive to remove honey, pollen, and debris. Providing bees with water can also encourage them to maintain cleanliness.</li>
						<li><strong>Clean the area around the hive:</strong> Remove debris from around the hive to make the area less attractive to ants.</li>
						<li><strong>Elevate the hive:</strong> Raising the hive on legs makes it harder for ants to enter.</li>
						<li><strong>Use an ant moat:</strong> Place a water-filled container between the hive stand and the hive to block ants from crossing.</li>
						<li><strong>Apply an insect repellent:</strong> Use repellents on the hive stand or legs to deter ants.</li>
						<li><strong>Use a sticky barrier:</strong> Apply products like Tanglefoot or petroleum jelly to hive stand legs to prevent ants from climbing.</li>
						<li><strong>Physical barriers:</strong> A line of petroleum jelly, duct tape, or cinnamon around the hive base can deter ants.</li>
						<li><strong>Ant traps:</strong> Anti-ant devices fixed to the bottom of the hive stand can help keep ants out.</li>
						<li><strong>Ant baits:</strong> Use borax or boric acid baits to kill ants at the source by having them carry poison back to their colony.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					<strong>Summary:</strong> Ants can pose a serious threat to bee colonies, but regular monitoring and proactive prevention strategies can keep infestations under control. Act quickly at the first sign of ant activity to
					protect your hive's health and productivity.

			<h3 id="wax-moths">Wax Moths</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Learn about Wax Moths</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Wax moths</strong> are common pests that infest honeybee hives, feeding on the beeswax and other materials in the hive. There are two species of wax moths: the greater wax moth (<em>Galleria mellonella</em>) and
					the lesser wax moth (<em>Achroia grisella</em>).
				</p>

				<p>
					Wax moths can have a negative impact on honeybee hives by causing damage to the comb, reducing the amount of food storage, and weakening the hive overall. The moths lay their eggs on the comb, and the larvae then hatch
					and begin feeding on the beeswax, honey, and other materials in the hive.
				</p>

				<p>
					The feeding activity of the larvae can cause extensive damage to the comb, which can weaken the structural integrity of the hive. In addition to physical damage, wax moths can also introduce bacterial and fungal diseases
					into the hive, further weakening the colony.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Symptoms of wax moth presence:</strong></p>

				<p>
					The first sign of a wax moth infestation is often the presence of small holes in the wax combs. As the larvae feed, they leave behind a fine silk webbing that can bind the wax combs together and cause them to collapse.
				</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>The presence of adult moths flying around the hive or near the entrance</li>
						<li>A foul odour coming from the hive, caused by wax moth larvae and the debris they produce</li>
						<li>Honeybee larvae that appear to have been eaten or partially consumed</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Treatments for Wax Moth Infestations:</strong></p>

				<p>If you suspect that your hive has a wax moth infestation, there are several treatments you can use to control the infestation:</p>

				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Keep colonies strong:</strong> A strong, healthy colony is better able to defend itself against wax moth infestations.</li>
						<li><strong>Use screened bottom boards:</strong> These can help prevent wax moths from entering the hive.</li>
						<li><strong>Store equipment properly:</strong> Store wax combs and other equipment in a cool, dry place.</li>
						<li><strong>Hive hygiene:</strong> Regular inspections and cleaning help detect and remove moth eggs or larvae early.</li>
						<li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Freezing infected components will kill larvae and eggs.</li>
						<li><strong>Pheromone traps:</strong> Useful for attracting and capturing adult moths.</li>
						<li><strong>Heat treatment:</strong> Heating to 120°F for several hours can eliminate wax moths and larvae.</li>
						<li><strong>Comb replacement:</strong> Replace severely damaged combs with clean ones.</li>
						<li><strong>Chemical treatments:</strong> Mothballs, paradichlorobenzene crystals, or acetic acid can be used cautiously and according to instructions.</li>

				<p>
					Wasps, particularly the common wasp (<em>Vespula vulgaris</em>) and German wasp (<em>Vespula germanica</em>), are aggressive pests that can pose a serious threat to honeybee colonies. During late summer and early autumn,
					wasps become more prevalent around hives, targeting weak colonies for their honey, pollen, and brood. They can rob hives, kill adult bees, and disrupt the colony’s ability to thrive.
				</p>

				<p>
					Wasps are particularly dangerous to honeybees because of their scavenging behaviour. Unlike bees, wasps do not die after stinging and can repeatedly attack. Their presence can cause panic and stress in the hive, leading
					to weakened defences and reduced productivity.
				</p>

				<strong><p>Symptoms of Wasp Activity:</p></strong>
				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Increased presence of wasps near or inside the hive entrance</li>
						<li>Dead bees found outside the hive, especially decapitated or torn apart</li>
						<li>Bees acting defensively or clustering near the entrance</li>
						<li>Damaged comb and missing brood or honey stores</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<strong><p>Wasp Control and Prevention:</p></strong>
				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Entrance reducers:</strong> Fit narrow entrance reducers to limit access and help bees defend their colony more effectively</li>
						<li><strong>Wasp traps:</strong> Hang baited wasp traps around the apiary, especially in late summer, to reduce the local wasp population</li>
						<li><strong>Good hive hygiene:</strong> Avoid spilling syrup or honey near the hive, and clean up any spilt feed or open containers</li>
						<li><strong>Seal weak colonies:</strong> Combine weaker hives or protect them with mesh screens if they are at risk of wasp invasion</li>
						<li><strong>Monitor daily:</strong> Regular inspections help detect wasp activity early before it becomes a major problem</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<strong><p>Repellents and Deterrents:</p></strong>
				<div class="indented-list">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Natural repellents:</strong> Clove oil, peppermint, and eucalyptus have been shown to deter wasps</li>
						<li><strong>Fake nests:</strong> Hanging artificial wasp nests can discourage new colonies from settling in the area</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<strong><p>Summary:</p></strong>
				<p>
					Wasps are an aggressive predator of honeybees and can cause major losses in late-season colonies. Taking proactive steps such as reducing hive entrances, setting traps, and practicing good hive hygiene is essential to
					protect your bees from wasp attacks. Strong, well-managed colonies are better able to defend themselves, making year-round colony health a vital part of wasp prevention.
